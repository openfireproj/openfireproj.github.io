# open FI/RE

Open source Financial Planning. Financial Independence / Retire Early.

## Mission Statement

To provide a highly usable interface to a large array of financial equations.  

This project is hosted on [openfireproj.github.io](https://openfireproj.github.io/). Presently, it's expected 
that you would use this in one browser, and you may optionally save some information about yourself locally 
in that browser.


### Adding Equations

Laymen may [contribute new equations](Contributing an Equation), without much knowlege of how this project works.

Equations can be complementary or contradictory to each other. Values can be shared between equations or two equations
can come to results using completely different methods.


## Developers

### Getting Started

You may of course run your own service using idomatic `npm` commands:

```
npm start
```

A `Makefile` is in the root directory which is also good for reference.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). [Get started with npm](README-NPM.md).


## Contributing an Equation

Add a directory in `src/equations/` that is unique to you or the space. A js file should be added for each new equation.

```
TODO EXAMPLE to be added.
